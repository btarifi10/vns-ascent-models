Description:
- Load Ve(t) from text file into NEURON vectors.
- First line in text file: dt.
- Second line in text file: tstop.
- Subsequent lines: One Ve(t) value per line.

Important notes:
- Ve(t) must be between -1 and 1. Scale this time course for the desired amplitude AND polarity during simulation.

Variables that must be defined in wrapper/params file:
- VeTime_fname: String with Ve(t) filename

objref dt_tmp, tstop_tmp
objref VeTime_file, VeTime_data

// Read in Ve(t)
proc VeTime_read() {
	VeTime_file = new File()
	VeTime_file.ropen(VeTime_fname)

	// Read in dt & tstop used to generate the time course in Matlab
	// Make sure they match the values being used in NEURON
	dt_tmp = new Vector(1)
	dt_tmp.scanf(VeTime_file,1)
	tstop_tmp = new Vector(1)
	tstop_tmp.scanf(VeTime_file,1)

	// Error checking
	if (dt_tmp.x[0] != dt) {

	// Close file
