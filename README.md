# Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) In Silico Models using ASCENT
__Basheq Tarifi__

This repo contains the ASCENT-based in silico models used to simulate rat cervical vagus nerve stimulation. By leveraging previous morphological studies and in vivo experiments, this project aims to replicate nerve fiber behaviors and explore the effects of stimulation parameters like pulse width, amplitude, and frequency.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
* ASCENT modeling of rat cervical vagus nerve samples.
* Simulation of biphasic pulse train stimulation via bipolar electrode cuffs.
    Parameter ranges:
        Pulse widths: 0.2-5 ms
        Amplitudes: 0.1-3 mA
        Frequencies: 1-50 Hz
    Large dataset creation:
        30,000+ entries linking stimulation parameters to nerve activation levels.
        13,000+ entries linking stimulation parameters to compound nerve action potentials.
